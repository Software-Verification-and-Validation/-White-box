## Iteration 8 - Final Coverage Analysis

### Coverage Achieved
- **Branch Coverage: 97%**
- **Total Tests: 73**
- **All tests passing: ✅**

### Remaining Uncovered Code

**Lines 721-722: Program Entry Point**

## Final Coverage: 97% Branch Coverage

### Uncovered Code
The remaining 3% consists of:
- **Lines 721-722**: `if __name__ == "__main__": main()`

### Technical Explanation
This is Python's entry point guard, which only executes during direct script
execution (`python main.py`). When running tests via `coverage run -m unittest`,
the module is imported, so `__name__ != "__main__"` and this branch is not taken.

### Testing Coverage
The `main()` function itself has been tested via subprocess calls in
`test_startup_banner()`, `test_I8_main_function_with_eof()`, and
`test_I8_main_function_normal_command()`. All interactive loop functionality
is verified.

### Conclusion
97% branch coverage achieved with comprehensive testing of all application
logic. The uncovered 3% is architectural boilerplate that cannot be executed
during unit testing without modifying production code (an anti-pattern).
